I'm Davide, a thirtysomething C# developer, based in Rome, working in the gambling industry. 

I had a 5 year experience as a consultant focusing on Microsoft technologies and products such as SharePoint and Dynamics Crm. I learnt a lot, working in over a hundred projects, teaching, mentoring and leading other people. I worked in different industries, saw a lot of code, saw a lot of bugs and did my part in fixing it. I also created some good stuff too. 

Before that I was doing a PhD in Math, but I left because I wasn't happy. I still enjoy math and I would love to work with it again. 

Apart from that I did:
* learn how to solve the rubik cube
* kickboxing 
* learn some lindy hop 

I hope you enjoy this simple website, don't hesitate to contact me if you like!
